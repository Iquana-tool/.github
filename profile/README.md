# IQUANA (Image Quantification and Analysis)

**IQUANA** is an interactive, open-source tool co-developed with marine ecologists to streamline image annotation and analysis in fields like marine ecology. It addresses the bottleneck of manual processes by leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision models for detailed object-level quantification.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **AI-Assisted Efficiency**: Provides streamlined workflows that integrate AI at multiple stages to improve annotation speed and quality.
* **Nested Object Structures**: Utilizes a novel data model that supports hierarchical relationships between organisms and their morphological features (e.g., relating polyps to specific corals).
* **User-Centric Design**: Features a modern, accessible interface tailored specifically for non-ML domain experts.
* **Object-Level Data**: Saves annotations with hierarchy information to enable nested segmentation for improved downstream analysis.

## 🛠 Core Functionalities

The tool offers three primary AI-driven computer vision capabilities:

1.  **Prompted Segmentation**: Generates detailed instance masks from simple inputs like points or bounding boxes. IQUANA integrates the **SAM 2.1** model for this purpose.
2.  **Exemplar-based Instance Discovery**: Finds target objects by providing exemplary instances of the target class. This is powered by **SAM 3** and **GeCo**.
3.  **Semantic Segmentation**: Predicts labels for every pixel based on a defined classification scheme. Integrated networks include **UNet**, **DeepLab**, and their extensions.

## 🏗 Software Architecture

Designed with a modular microservice architecture, IQUANA prioritizes scalability and maintainability.

* **Frontend**: A high-fidelity system created using JavaScript and React.js.
* **Backend**: Written in Python using **FastAPI** to simplify the integration of modern AI models.
* **Task Management**: Uses **Celery**, a task distribution queue framework, to manage long-running tasks like model training or inference across multiple images.
* **Deployment**: Everything is **Dockerized**, allowing for local or cloud deployment to ensure accessibility for different labs.

## 📊 Preliminary Results

Initial usability tests with marine ecologists showed:
* **Usability**: A System Usability Scale (SUS) score of **85**.
* **Cognitive Load**: A low raw NASA-TLX score of **20**.
* **Efficiency**: Users described prompted segmentation as "way better and faster" than traditional manual approaches.
